\title{Test gene sets for unidirectional enrichment}
\usage{
testUnidirectionality(barycoords, gsets, Gdiffexp = NULL,
  statistic = "diffexp", bm = NULL, minknown = 5, mindiffexp = 0,
  maxknown = 1500, mc.cores = getOption("mc.cores", default = 1), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{barycoords}{Dataframe containing for every gene its barycentric coordinates, as returned by \code{\link[triwise]{transformBarycentric}}}

\item{gsets}{List of character vectors, each containing a set of genes (gene identifiers)}

\item{Gdiffexp}{Differentially expressed genes}

\item{statistic}{A string denoting the measure used for the strength of upregulation of a particular gene. \itemize{
  \item diffexp: Whether a gene is differentially expressed (1 versus 0)
  \item rank: The rank of the maximal log fold-change
  \item r: The maximal log fold-change
  \item z: Custom using the z-column within barycoords
  \item angle: Uses a rayleigh z-test ignoring non-differentially expressed genes within the gene set
}}

\item{bm}{Previously calculated background model using the \code{\link[triwise]{generateBackgroundModel}}}

\item{minknown}{Minimal number of genes within a gene set for it to be considered for enrichment}

\item{mindiffexp}{Minimal number of genes differentially expressed within a gene set for it to be considered for enrichment}

\item{maxknown}{Maximal number of genes within a gene set for it to be considered for enrichment}

\item{mc.cores}{Number of processor cores to use. Due to limitations of the parallel package, this does not work on Windows}

\item{...}{Parameters for \code{\link[triwise]{generateBackgroundModel}}}
}
\value{
Dataframe containing for every gene set which passed the filtering: \itemize{
 \item p-value of unidirectionality
 \item q-value of unidirectionality (p-value corrected for multiple testing)
 \item average angle
}
